# Goal
In the first part of this lab you'll get to explore some real live threat data(tm)*. All sorts of fun and exciting things will be yours to experiment with. You'll start by reading and cleaning up data (surprise), and you'll finish by exploring K-Means clustering and PCA! 


*Real live threat data is domains and IPs

# Requirements
* IPython
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib/Pylab
* Scipy
* Scikit Learn

# Data
