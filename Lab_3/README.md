# Goal
This lab aims to show basic statistical techniques in Python. This includes how to get the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation from a data set. In addition to looking at data distributions, some commonly used plot types for data exploration and summarization are covered as well as a brief introduction to some iPython magic functions.
