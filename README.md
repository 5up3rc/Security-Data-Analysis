# Security Data Analysis

## Introduction

This is a two day class I, [Mike Sconzo](https://twitter.com/sooshie), put together a while back with some help from [David Dorsey](https://twitter.com/trogdorsey). I gave this workshop at BSidesDFW and it seemed to go ok. However, it's being re-written so I'm open sourcing this version for everybody to enjoy, and hopefully learn from.

The goal over all five labs will be to get comfortable doing data analysis as well as machine learning in Python. Ideally there will be some hand holding initially and then as things progress it begins to assume you remember the techniques that were covered in prior labs. However, if you have questions/problems/fixes feel free to open issues and pull requests. Or worst case contact me via twitter.

Good luck and enjoy!
