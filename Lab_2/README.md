# Goal
In this lab, the techniques in the first lab are built on to do basic timeseries analysis (graphing and summarization). For the first part of the lab some Bro data (http.log) is used. Additionally the groupby() capability of Pandas will be examined.

# Requirements
* IPython
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* GeoIP

# Data
* Full dataset available [here](http://www.secrepo.com/Security-Data-Analysis/Lab_2/http.log.zip). This is the *http.log* referenced in this lab (Lab 2).
* Honeypot data is in the zip file in this git repot. This is the *honeypot.json* referenced in this lab (Lab 2.1). You must unzip honeypot.json.zip prior to running through the lab.
