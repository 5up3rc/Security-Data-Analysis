# Goal
In this lab, the techniques in the first lab are built on to do basic timeseries analysis (graphing and summarization). For the first part of the lab some Bro data (http.log) is used. Additionally the groupby() capability of Pandas will be examined. In the second part of the lab (2.1) honeypot data will be used to demonstrate looking for patterns over time in honeypot data. More timeseries graphing will be covered as well as a technique for determining if two variables are correlated over time. Make sure to let us know if you find anything interesting in the data!


# Requirements
* IPython

# Data
* Full dataset available [here](http://www.secrepo.com/Security-Data-Analysis/Lab_2/http.log.zip). This is the *http.log* referenced in this lab (Lab 2).
* Honeypot data is available [here](http://www.secrepo.com/honeypot/honeypot.json.zip). This is the *honeypot.json* referenced in this lab (Lab 2.1). You must unzip honeypot.json.zip prior to running through the lab.
